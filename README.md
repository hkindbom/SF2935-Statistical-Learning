# SF2935-Statistical-Learning
Projects from the master course in statistical learning on KTH, fall 2019

Both projects are based on the auto dataset, which contains characteristics of some vehicles and their mpg (miles per gallon). 
Additionally, classification was performed on a synthetic multivariate Gaussian sample.  

### Tools
**Python 3**:
*scikit-learn*, *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib* 

## Project 1
Evaluating the following classifiers:
* QDA
* LDA
* Logistic Regression
* KNN

## Project 2
